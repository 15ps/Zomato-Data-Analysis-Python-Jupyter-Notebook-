# Zomato Data-Analysis (Python-Jupyter Notebook)
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing a sample Zomato restaurant dataset (CSV format) to understand customer preferences, dining habits, and rating patterns. The analysis was performed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies Used:
Dataset: Sample Zomato restaurant data (CSV),
Programming Language: Python,
Environment: Jupyter Notebook,
Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn,

ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings:
Dining-type restaurants are the most popular and receive the highest number of votes from customers.
Most user ratings are concentrated between 3.5 and 4.25, indicating generally positive feedback.
The most frequent order is for two people, with an average cost of around â‚¹300, suggesting itâ€™s a common dining pattern.
Online orders tend to receive better customer ratings, possibly due to convenience or ease of access.
